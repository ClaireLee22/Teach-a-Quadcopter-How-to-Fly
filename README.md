# Teach-a-Quadcopter-How-to-Fly
Reinforcement Learning(RL) Project [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree]

## Project Overview
Use Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients(DDPG), an actor-critic method, to build the agent that can learn desired control behaviors, takeoff, on their own. Shape reward functions and train the agent to achieve the takeoff task.
